## My .vim settings with Vundle

### Keep your dotfiles in git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dimitardanailov/dotvimfiles ~/.vim/
```

If you need Move the `.vimrc` and `.gvimrc` files into the `.vim` directory:

```bash
mv .vimrc ~/.vim/vimrc
```

```bash
mv .gvimrc ~/.vim/gvimrc
```

Create symbolic links so that `~/.vimrc` points to the `~/.vim/vimrc` file:

```bash
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

```bash
ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
```

### Installing your Vim environment on another machine

Once your vim configuration is under version control, itâ€™s quite straightforward to import your settings to any machine that has git installed. If you followed the instructions above to put your vimrc and plugins in a dotvim directory, then you can follow these steps to synchronise them to another machine:

<code>
cd ~
</code>

<code>
git clone http://github.com/username/dotvim.git ~/.vim
</code>

<code>
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
</code>

<code>
ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
</code>

<code>
cd ~/.vim
</code>

### Vundle

Documentation: [Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)

1. Introduction:

   Installation requires [Git] and triggers [`git clone`] for each configured repository to `~/.vim/bundle/` by default.
   Curl is required for search.

   If you are using Windows, go directly to [Windows setup]. If you run into any issues, please consult the [FAQ].
   See [Tips] for some advanced configurations.

   Using non-POSIX shells, such as the popular Fish shell, requires additional setup. Please check the [FAQ].

2. Set up [Vundle]:

   `$ git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`

3. Install Plugins:

   Launch `vim` and run `:PluginInstall`

   To install from command line: `vim +PluginInstall +qall`
